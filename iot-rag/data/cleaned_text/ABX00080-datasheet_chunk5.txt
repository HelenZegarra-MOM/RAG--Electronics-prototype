where uno r4 minima continues its legacy. the board features the standard 14 digital i / o ports, 6 analog channels, dedicated pins for i2c, spi and uart connections. compared to its predecessors the board has a much larger memory : 8 times more flash memory ( 256 kb ) and 16 times more sram ( 32 kb ). entry level projects : if this is your first project within coding and electronics, the uno r4 minima is a good fit. it is easy to get started with and has a lot of online documentation ( both official + third party ). easy power management : the uno r4 minima has a barrel jack connector and supports input voltages from 6 - 24 v. this connector is widely popular and removes the need for additional circuitry required to step down the voltage. cross compatibility : the uno form factor automatically makes it compatible with hundreds of existing third - party shields and other accessories. 1. 2 related products arduino uno r3 arduino uno r3 smd arduino uno r4 wifi arduino uno r4 minima 6 / 35 arduino uno r4 minima modified : 19 / 06 / 2025 rating 2 recommended operating conditions symbol description min typ max unit vin input voltage from vin pad / dc jack 6 7. 0 24 v vusb input voltage from usb connector 4. 8 5. 0 5. 5 v top operating temperature - 40 25 85 c arduino uno r4 minima 7 / 35 arduino uno r4 minima modified : 19 / 06 / 2025 functional overview 3 block diagram arduino uno r4 minima block diagram arduino uno r4 minima 8 / 35 arduino uno r4 minima modified : 19 / 06 / 2025 4 board topology 4. 1 front view top view of arduino uno r4 minima ref. description ref. description u1 r7fa4m1ab3cfm # aa0 microcontroller ic j4 dc jack u2 isl854102frz - t buck converter dl1 led tx ( serial transmit ) pb1 reset button dl2 led rx ( serial receive ) janalog analog input / output headers dl3 led power jdigital digital input / output headers dl4 led sck ( serial clock ) j1 icsp header ( spi ) d2 pmeg6020aelrx schottky diode j2 swd / jtag connector d
