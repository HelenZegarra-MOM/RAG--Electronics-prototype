, the 5v pin does not supply voltage but is rather connected, through a jumper, to the usb power input. 1. 1 application examples sound spectrum : create a sound spectrum to visualize sound frequencies. connect an nano 33 ble and a microphone or amplifier. social distancing sensor : keeping the social distance has become more important than ever to ensure your own, as well as others health. by connecting an arduino nano 33 ble with a sensor and a led display, you can create a wearable band that alerts you when you get too close to other people. healthy plant scanner : watering your plants isnt always enough to keep them happy. diseases, lack of sunlight etc. could also be vital factors for unhealthy plants. keep your plants happy by creating a detector and train it to detect any diseases, all with an nano 33 ble. 1. 2 ratings 1. 2. 1 recommended operating conditions symbol description min max conservative thermal limits for the whole board : - 40 c ( 40 f ) 85c ( 185 f ) 1. 3 power consumption symbol description min typ max unit pbl power consumption with busy loop tbc mw plp power consumption in low power mode tbc mw pmax maximum power consumption tbc mw 2 functional overview 2. 1 board topology 2. 1. 1 top arduino nano 33 ble 4 / 12 arduino nano 33 ble modified : 19 / 06 / 2025 board topology top ref. description ref. description u1 nina - b306 module bluetooth low energy 5. 0 module u6 mp2322gqh step down converter u2 lsm9ds1tr sensor imu pb1 it - 1185ap1c - 160g - gtr push button dl1 led l dl2 led power 2. 1. 2 bottom board topology bottom ref. description ref. description sj1 vusb jumper sj2 d7 jumper sj3 d8 jumper sj4 3v3 jumper arduino nano 33 ble 5 / 12 arduino nano 33 ble modified : 19 / 06 / 2025 2. 2 processor the main processor is a arm cortex - m4f running at up to 64mhz. most of its pins are connected to the external headers, however some are reserved for internal communication with the wireless module and the on - board internal i2c peripherals ( imu and crypto ). note : as opposed to other arduino nano boards, pins
