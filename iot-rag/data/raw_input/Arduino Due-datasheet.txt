The Arduino Due combines the performance of the Atmel SAM3X8E microcontroller with the flexibility of the
Arduino platform, offering a versatile solution for developers, hobbyists, and professionals alike. With its 32-bit
architecture and clock speed of 84 MHz, the Due delivers robust performance for demanding applications.
Embedded Systems Development: The Arduino Due can be utilized to create a real-time data acquisition
system for monitoring and analyzing environmental parameters in industrial settings. By interfacing sensors
such as temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors with the Due's abundant I/O pins, developers can capture
real-time data and process it using the Due's powerful microcontroller. The system can then transmit this data
wirelessly or via USB to a host computer for analysis, allowing for continuous monitoring and remote
management of critical processes.
Robotics: The Arduino Due can serve as the brain of an autonomous mobile robot capable of navigating and
interacting with its environment. By integrating sensors such as ultrasonic range finders, gyroscopes, and
encoders, developers can equip the robot with perception capabilities to sense its surroundings and detect
obstacles. Using the Due's abundant I/O pins and powerful processing capabilities, algorithms for localization,
mapping, and path planning can be implemented to enable autonomous navigation. Additionally, actuators
such as motors or servos can be controlled by the Due to execute motion commands, allowing the robot to
move and manipulate objects in its environment autonomously.
3D Printing & CNC Machines: The Arduino Due can function as a versatile controller for DIY projects. By
interfacing stepper motor drivers and end-stop switches with the Due's numerous I/O pins, enthusiasts can
create their own 3D printers or CNC machines. The Due's high-speed processing capabilities enable precise
control of stepper motors for accurate positioning and movement.
Prototyping: The Arduino Due serves as an invaluable tool for quickly iterating and testing new ideas for IoT
devices. By leveraging the Due's extensive I/O capabilities and compatibility with various sensors,
communication modules, and actuators, developers can rapidly assemble and test prototypes of IoT devices.

6.4 Power Supply
The Arduino Due can be powered in multiple ways:
USB Type-B port (Native port and Programming port).
Using an external voltage source connected to VIN pin, which has a recommended voltage range of 7-12 VCC.
The Power Jack: The Due can be powered using a DC power supply connected to the power jack, which accepts
a voltage range of 7 to 12 V.
It is essential to note that the Arduino Due operates at 3.3 V, so any external power source must be
regulated to this voltage level. Additionally, the power supply should be able to provide sufficient current
for the board's operation and any connected peripherals.

7 Device Operation
7.1 Getting Started - IDE
If you want to program your Arduino Due while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE [1]. To connect
the Arduino Due to your computer, you will need a USB Type-B cable, which can also provide power to the board, as
indicated by the LED (DL1).
7.2 Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor
All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor [2], by just installing a
simple plugin.
The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support
for all boards. Follow [3] to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.
7.3 Getting Started - Arduino Cloud
All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze
sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.
7.4 Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless
possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub [4], the Arduino Library Reference [5], and the
online store [6]; where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.
7.5 Board Recovery
All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the
processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB, it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-
tapping the reset button right after the power-up.

Exemptions: No exemptions are claimed.
Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006
concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the
SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High
Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities
totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do
not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and

Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list
published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.
9.4 Conflict Minerals Declaration
As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regard to laws
and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum,
Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder or as a component in metal
alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence, Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain
to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare
that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.
9.5 FCC Caution
Any Changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the users
authority to operate the equipment.
This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:
(1) This device may not cause harmful interference
(2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.
FCC RF Radiation Exposure Statement:
1. This Transmitter must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter.
2. This equipment complies with RF radiation exposure limits set forth for an uncontrolled environment.
3. This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 20 cm between the radiator &
your body.
Note: This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to
part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in
